# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Roller Coaster Dataset

# Overview
This project involves performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a roller coaster dataset. The aim is to understand the dataset, identify patterns, and uncover insights related to various aspects of roller coasters, such as their specifications, ratings, and geographical distribution.

# Dataset
The dataset contains information about various roller coasters, including:

Name: Name of the roller coaster
Park: Name of the amusement park where the roller coaster is located
Location: Geographical location of the park
Manufacturer: Company that manufactured the roller coaster
Type: Type of roller coaster (e.g., steel, wooden)
Height: Height of the roller coaster
Speed: Maximum speed of the roller coaster
Inversions: Number of inversions (loops) in the roller coaster
Year_opened: Year the roller coaster was opened
Rating: User rating of the roller coaster
Tools and Libraries Used
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
matplotlib: For data visualization
seaborn: For advanced visualization
numpy: For numerical operations
Installation
To install the necessary libraries, you can use pip:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
# Steps and Methodology

Data Preparation

Load the dataset and perform initial data cleaning.
Handle missing values, if any.
Convert data types as necessary.
Feature Understanding

Gain an understanding of the features in the dataset.
Describe each feature and its role in the analysis.
Feature Relationships

Explore relationships between different features.
Use visualization techniques to understand correlations and interactions.
Data Preparation
Load the dataset and perform necessary data cleaning steps, such as handling missing values and correcting data types.

Feature Understanding
Describe each feature in the dataset and its significance. This step helps in understanding the context of the data and what each feature represents.

Feature Relationships
Explore the relationships between different features using visualization techniques. This can include pair plots, correlation matrices, and other visual tools to uncover patterns and interactions.

Example Code

python

Import Libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

Load Dataset
data = pd.read_csv('roller_coasters.csv')

Data Preparation
data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)  # Example of handling missing values
data['Year_opened'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Year_opened'], format='%Y')  # Converting to datetime

Feature Understanding
print(data.describe())

Feature Relationships
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()

Pair Plot
sns.pairplot(data)
plt.show()

# Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive EDA on the roller coaster dataset, helping to understand the data, identify patterns, and prepare the data for further analysis or modeling. By leveraging visualization techniques, we can gain valuable insights and make informed decisions about subsequent steps in the data analysis process.
